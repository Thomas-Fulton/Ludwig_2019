#          ### Mutation plots for multiple SRRs ###
# 
# FORMAT: one lineage path per line, with sample names separated by a single space " ". The first string on line is an arbitrary name for the path through a lineage. This is also the base name for output image files. Next the SRR names of the samples should be listed in the correct order. To plot a mutation load profile for a specific position across the lineage path, the string "VARIANTS_OF_INTEREST" should be appended and followed by the position of interest.
# NOTE: There must be NO SPACES AT THE END OF A LINE.
# Commented lines with a "# " are ignored (a space after the # is necessary)
